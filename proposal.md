# Major Project Proposal

## Description
This a grid based game, where the main player will have to go around and eat the fruits, but have to stay away from the monsters(enemy). The player will have the same special abilities as the enemy in the game. There will be open places or places covered in ice, where the fruits will be and the monsters will be guarding the fruits and the eplayer have to break the ice, create it's path to the ice before the monsters gets there. As the level increases the quantity of the monsters and fruits will increase too.
